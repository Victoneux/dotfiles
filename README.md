# spooky_dotfiles
The dotfiles for my Arch Linux rice, a GTK-integrated rice for my laptop and desktop. You probably shouldn't use it, my code is spaghetti.

Required Packages:

Pacman: awesome rofi 

AUR (yay): picom-git betterlockscreen ly

Meant to be used with gensymlinks.sh, to keep everything updated from the repo.
