# spooky_dotfiles
The dotfiles for my Arch Linux rice, made for my laptop and desktop. You probably shouldn't use it, my code is spaghetti.

Required Packages:
  pacman -S awesome rofi 
  yay -S picom-git betterlockscreen ly

Uses gensymlinks.sh to generate links betweeen ~/dotfiles and misc locations to keep all dotfiles updated from one central location.
