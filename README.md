# awesome-dotfiles
The dotfiles for my Arch Linux rice, made for my desktop (eugh, nvidia drivers, no wayland :<). You probably shouldn't use any of them, my code is spaghetti.

Required Packages:
  pacman -S **awesome rofi sddm**
  yay -S **picom-animations-git**

Uses gensymlinks.sh to generate links betweeen ~/dotfiles and misc locations to keep all dotfiles updated from one central location.
