# awesome-dotfiles
The dotfiles for my Arch Linux rice. Complete spaghetti code, but if it works, it works!

Required Packages:
  pacman -S **awesome rofi sddm**
  yay -S **picom-animations-git**

Uses gensymlinks.sh to generate links betweeen ~/dotfiles and misc locations to keep all dotfiles updated from one central location.
